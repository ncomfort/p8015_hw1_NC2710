## Problem 0.1

This “problem” focuses on the use of R Markdown to write reproducible reports, GitHub for version control, and R Projects to organize your work.

To address Problem 0.1, I've:
* created a public GitHub repo titled p8105_hw1_NC2710 + local R Project
* create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw1_NC2710.Rmd that renders to github_document
